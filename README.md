# DocuSign-Integration
Develop a standalone application which integrates with Only Office and DocuSign and covers the following use cases
  •	Ability to generate asset request using a respective form that generates PDF based on the UI input controls
  •	The generated PDF goes to the Asset Manager to sign using DocuSign Integration
  •	Display the signed document in the asset request queue
  • Ability to generate a project management report (excel) file through a input form using Only Office based on a defined input screen
Build a simple workflow with following actors/process flow:
  •	Employee: fills in a leave form that generates a leave request DOCX
  •	Manager: the respective DOCX goes to the manager who fills in the comments and can approve/reject the leave request
  •	Admin: If the manager approves it after adding required comments, the leave request DOCX file goes to HR for final approval where they can add the comment. Once the HR     
    approves, the employee would get the final approval PDF for record
