**Build a simple workflow with following actors/process flow:<br>**
  >•	Employee: fills in a leave form that generates a leave request DOCX<br>
  >•	Manager: the respective DOCX goes to the manager who fills in the comments and can approve/reject the leave request<br>
  >•	Admin: If the manager approves it after adding required comments, the leave request DOCX file goes to HR for final approval where they can add the comment 
   Once the HR approves, the employee would get the final approval PDF for record
